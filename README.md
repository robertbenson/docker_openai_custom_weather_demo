This demo uses the [example code](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_call_functions_with_chat_models) available from OpenAI.






# Demo Weather app using OpenAI - _Function Calling_

This is a Python script using OpenAI that uses a _natural language_ prompt to demonstrate the OpenAI [function calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling) capabilities.

The example at OpenAI has _mock_ weather api calls, this version has amended the [example code](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_call_functions_with_chat_models) to use real-time OpenWeather api calls and a formatting request has been added.


## Run as a Docker Image


This demo is available as a Docker image: 


### Pull

```cmd
docker pull rbenson789/demo_openai_weather
```
### Run

```cmd
docker run -i  rbenson789/demo_openai_weather
```


## Run as a Python Script

### API Keys
Two api keys are required. One for OpenAI and the other for OpenWeather. This will require setting up an account for each.

### Install Packages
_Check Virtual Environment, make sure to activate._

#### manage env variables
```cmd
pip install python_dotenv
```
#### OpenAI
```cmd
pip install --upgrade openai
```

### run
```cmd
python main.py
```



# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

RAG allows real-time data and other data, that would not ordinarily be available to the LLM, to be incorporated into model generated responses.

New information, just released into the public domain will have missed the last LLM build.

There may also be valid reasons to keep information out of the public domain:

- Data regulations e.g. GDPR regulations introduced by the European Union in 2018 have reduced the amount of personal information available in the public domain.
- Competitive advantage: Research and Development 
- Confidentiality: finance, defense , medical are example sectors that would keep information confidential.
- Security, govt agencies etc. will have confidential information.

## Citations 

Documents can be uploaded to the model using "file search". Information from these documents (PDFs, Word files, text files etc) can be used to _ground_ responses and sources will be credited.

 


## _It doesn't know what it doesn't know_ - Donald Rumsfeld

The LLM model can only work with data available to it. If it doesn't know about it, it will not be part of the build.

However, function calling, can make data available to the model, that would not have ordinarily been available to it.

The retrieved information, using predefined api's, is used to "augment" the model data to give more detailed, grounded responses.

For example, a car manufacturer has released a new car since the last LLM build and wants to make that information available. This can now be achieved with function calling.


# RAG allows the model to consider data that was not originally known to the LLM.

The example OpenAI [Code](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_call_functions_with_chat_models) has been modified to:

1. change the content for my use case, add actual real-time weather (openweather)
2. change the instructions , request additional information and format the output
3. add a loop to allow repeated prompt requests
4. make a Docker Hub repository `rbenson789/demo_openai_weather`

The repository on Docker Hub can be pulled and run on a local machine.

```console
docker pull rbenson789/demo_openai_weather
```
```console
docker run -i rbenson789/demo_openai_weather
```

Weather data is supplied by openWeather api calls.

The user is invited to enter a natural language prompt, free format, with suggested guidelines.

OpenAI will determine the model arguments for building JSON for calls to a weather api. 
The setting up, and processing the return data will be handled by the model. 
The actual api call itself is a predefined api.
In this case, openweather api calls are used to augment model data. 

Any other weather agency could be used to fulfil the user requirements. 

In the example code, 3 locations are used in the prompt, detected by the model, 3 api calls return data to the model.

Using the information in the user prompt, the model will make a response using context and inferences.

### _Usage_ for this prompt

The word usage is in italics. There is no strictly correct _Usage_ in the traditional sense.

OpenAI with **_function calling_** does not operate in a strictly defined structure of semantics and arguments. 


Using the prompt guidelines, enter a natural language prompt along the lines of:

```console
    What's the weather like in <location 1> <location 2> [<location>...] [% chance of rain] [language] [metric | imperial]
```

this will also work, but be prepared for some _interesting_ results.
```console
    <location 1> <location 2> [<location>...]
```

### Hallucination

When the prompt is vague, lacks context, is an unsolvable question , the model may generate a response that includes incorrect or fabricated information.

This is called hallucination.

Enter random words for the prompt, expect a random answer. 

A random response is _"technically correct"_ in that it aligns with how the model is designed to work. 

However, the goal is to provide accurate and reliable information.

#### Prompt
```console
    horse
```

This prompt does not meet many of the guideline criteria. A random response should therefore be expected.

This is the response for _horse_.

```
| Metric          | Horse Location üåßÔ∏è             |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| Description     | Partly cloudy with rain       |
| Temperature     | 15.57 ¬∞C                      |
| UV Index        | 5.26                          |
| Humidity        | 55%                           |
| Wind Speed      | 18.324 km/h                   |
| Wind Direction  | 293¬∞                          |
| Latitude        | 51.9257                       |
| Longitude       | -1.3704                       |

**Precautions for UV Index 5.26:**
- Wear sunglasses with UV protection to safeguard your eyes.
- Use sunscreen with SPF 30+ to protect exposed skin.
- Wear a hat to shield your face and neck.
- Stay in the shade during midday hours when the sun is strongest.
- Seek protective clothing like long sleeves and pants where possible.

Stay safe and enjoy your day!
```

The JSON generated by the model gave a latitude and longitude for horse as:
```json
{"latitude":"53.2794","longitude":"-7.062","language":"en","unit":"metric"}
```

this location is in the midlands of Ireland and has no obvious connection to the word horse.

**The better the prompt, the better the output. A poor prompt will give a poor response.**

---
## Assistant

The assistant requires 3 inputs:
1. The model version, in this case gpt-4o
2. Functions to run
3. Instructions

### Instructions

This gives the model:
1. A persona to take, in this case, it is a weather bot. 
2. directions on how to run, i.e. use functions to answer questions.
3. The uv index on its own is not that meaningful. The model is told to refine that answer to add guidelines re sun exposure.
4. Add an emoji

```console
    You are a weather bot. 
    Use the provided functions to answer questions. 
    Add a detailed description of the precautions to take for that particular uvi. 
    All output should be in requested language. 
    Add an emoji for the weather eg sun for sunshine. 
    The output should be in a table format with metrics down and locations across
```


### Tools/Functions

**Function calling** uses defined functions that the model calls to retrieve relevant data. The functions and respective arguments are defined.
The model determines the function to call by the information available to it, using input, context and inference. 

If the prompt is asking for weather, it will call the _get_current_weather_ function.
If the prompt is looking for probability of rain, it will call the _get_rain_probability_ function.

### longitude and latitude ? 

The api requests to openWeather require longitude and latitude to return JSON formatted weather results for that area. 

These have not been supplied by the user nor derived within the Python code. 

The model has been asked to supply these as required arguments to build JSON for api calls. 
By using input locations, context and inference, the model can determine these.

## Prompt
Creating a good prompt is important. A good prompt can significantly enhance the quality of the model's output.

Be specific and avoid unnecessary information that may distract from the main task.

This example would expect to _see_ locations, language, percentage, units in the prompt. A vague and unspecific prompt may give vague results.

                            },
                            "longitude": {
                                "type": "string",
                                "description": "The longitude of a place",
                            },

                        "required": ["latitude", "longitude"],
                    }
                }
            },

        ]
```

JSON response from the _get_current_weather_ function. 
The returned information from the api call will be augmented to the model. The model response will contain the following information. 

```console
result = {
        "description": weather_daily_summary,
        "temperature": weather_daily_temperature,
        "feels_like": weather_daily_temperature_feels_like,
        "humidity": weather_daily_humidity,
        "wind_speed": weather_daily_wind_speed,
        "wind_direction": weather_daily_wind_degree,
        "latitude": latitude,
        "longitude": longitude,
    }
```

### Example prompt
```console
    What's the weather like in Sydney, Paris and Dublin, % chance of rain, in imperial units 
```

### UV Index Precautions:
- **Sydney (UVI 2.85)**: Low risk. It's safe to be outside. Wear sunglasses on bright days.
- **Paris (UVI 3.63)**: Moderate risk. Use sunscreen SPF 30+, wear sunglasses and a hat if outside for extended periods.
- **Dublin (UVI 4.41)**: Moderate risk. Don a hat and sunglasses, and apply broad-spectrum SPF 30+ sunscreen if outside for prolonged periods.

Stay prepared and stay safe!
